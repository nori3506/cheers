## Problem to tackle
Have you ever hesitated to order cocktails you have never tried in a bar or restaurant or have you ever wondered whether you would like the taste of a bottle of drinks you never tried before?  It’s not easy  to guess the drink's taste from their name.
And also, it’s too expensive to just try.
