# Cheers!

## Problem to tackle
Have you ever hesitated to order cocktails you have never tried in a bar or restaurant or have you ever wondered whether you would like the taste of a bottle of drinks you never tried before?  It’s not easy  to guess the drink's taste from their name.
And also, it’s too expensive to just try.

## Our Solution: Cheers!

## Why Cheers?
There are existing review apps such as yelp, google Maps, and trip advisor, but most of their users focusing on food menus and it is difficult to get drink information.
